This directory contains a simple example that shows how to use DropZone.

The Elm Json Decode Library ["oneOrMore"](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/Json-Decode#oneOrMore) function has an example on how you could write a decoder for the FileList returned from drop event.

This example will decode some of the attributes from the dropped files on the page.
